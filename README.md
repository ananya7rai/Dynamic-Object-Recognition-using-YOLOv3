# Dynamic Object Recognition using YOLOv3 #
In this project, I implemented a real-time object detection system leveraging the YOLOv3 algorithm. The project focuses on accurately identifying and localizing multiple objects in images by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks, ensuring a balance of speed and precision for practical applications.

## Dataset Details ##
Kaggle - I used kaggle for the dataset which contains weights, configurations and labels for the YOLO network.

## Proposed Architecture ##
After importing all the necessary libraries, I set the parameters for the YOLO configuration and loaded the YOLO network. Then I defined a Detection function and bounding boxes function as a part of the algorithm. Concluded the project with processing and displaying images in a group of 5.
